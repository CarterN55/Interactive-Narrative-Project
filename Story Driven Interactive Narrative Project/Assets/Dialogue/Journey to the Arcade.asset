    dialogueText: "Today, the arcade has brought in brand new games for people to
      play. To get to the arcade, you need to take the bus, however, word on the
      street is that there is another way to get there. You wake up with a feeling
      of excitement. You get all your things and make your way to the bus stop. You
      arrive at the bus stop. Many minutes go by and the bus still hasn\u2019t arrived
      yet. You then think about the rumored other way to get to the arcade."

        dialogueText: You wait another 30 minutes but finally, the bus arrives. You
          get on the bus and are on your way to the arcade. Everything seems fine
          until at one stop, a man enters the bus and then pulls out a gun, threatening
          the driver and forcing him to drive to a bank. This bank just so happens
          to be in the same plaza as the arcade. You are forced to wait for the bus
          to arrive at the bank so that the hijacker leaves and enters the bank.
        responses:
        - responseText: Continue
          nextNode:
            dialogueText: The bus eventually arrives at the bank. Once the hijacker
              gets off the bus and enters the bank, you squeeze through the doors
              and run to the arcade. After getting inside the arcade, you finally
              can play, unfortunately, the hijacker who just finished robbing the
              bank, has entered the arcade and is looking to rob it as well. He is
              currently facing the employee with his back toward you. Nearby is a
              spare hammer for one of the arcade machines that looks like it has
              a blunt surface.

            - responseText: Knock him out
              nextNode:
                dialogueText: You knock the robber and he falls to the ground. The
                  employee begins to call 911 and tells you to grab the gun and keep
                  an eye on him until police arrive. The police eventually arrive
                  and take the him away. Although the robber was arrested, the arcade
                  is now closed until tomorrow.

                      time to hopefully get to play in the arcade. You walk out the
                      door and see a police officer telling you to enter his car.
                      You reluctantly enter and he begins driving. After some time,
                      you arrive at the arcade. The officer tells you that after
                      what you went through yesterday, this was their way of saying
                      thank you.

                  Turns out trying to take a gun from someone wasn\u2019t as easy
                  as you thought. You were shot and killed trying to stop the hijacker."

          the direction of the arcade. The forest is quiet, calm and peaceful. Everything
          seems fine. After quite some time, you finally arrive at the arcade. Only
          to see police outside the arcade. It turns out that someone hijacked the
          bus you would have taken and used to rob a bank and the arcade. After all
          that time taking the another path, you ended up avoiding a dangerous situation.
          Even though you couldn\u2019t play at the arcade, at least you\u2019re
          not dead."
